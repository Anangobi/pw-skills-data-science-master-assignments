Sure, I'd be happy to explain!

1. **Lasso Regression**:
   - Lasso Regression, short for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a type of linear regression that uses L1 regularization. It adds a penalty term to the ordinary least squares objective, where the penalty is the absolute sum of the coefficients multiplied by a regularization parameter.
   - It differs from other regression techniques, like ordinary least squares regression, by penalizing the absolute size of the regression coefficients rather than their squared values (as in Ridge Regression). This makes Lasso Regression capable of performing feature selection by driving some coefficients to zero.

2. **Advantage in Feature Selection**:
   - The main advantage of Lasso Regression in feature selection is its ability to automatically perform feature selection by shrinking some coefficients to exactly zero. This effectively removes irrelevant or less important features from the model, leading to a simpler and potentially more interpretable model.

3. **Interpreting Coefficients**:
   - In Lasso Regression, the coefficients can be interpreted similarly to those in ordinary linear regression. However, due to the penalty term, some coefficients might be exactly zero, indicating that the corresponding features have been excluded from the model.

4. **Tuning Parameters**:
   - The main tuning parameter in Lasso Regression is the regularization parameter, often denoted by \(\lambda\) (lambda). This parameter controls the strength of the penalty applied to the coefficients. Higher values of \(\lambda\) lead to more coefficients being pushed towards zero, potentially resulting in sparser models.

5. **Non-linear Regression**:
   - Lasso Regression is inherently a linear regression technique and is primarily suited for linear problems. However, when combined with suitable feature transformations (e.g., polynomial features, interaction terms), it can be used for capturing non-linear relationships.

6. **Difference from Ridge Regression**:
   - Both Ridge and Lasso Regression are linear regression techniques with regularization, but they differ in the type of penalty applied. Ridge uses L2 regularization, penalizing the squared sum of coefficients, while Lasso uses L1 regularization, penalizing the absolute sum of coefficients. Lasso tends to produce sparse models by driving some coefficients to zero, whereas Ridge tends to shrink coefficients towards zero without making them exactly zero.

7. **Handling Multicollinearity**:
   - Lasso Regression has the ability to handle multicollinearity to some extent by automatically performing feature selection. By driving some coefficients to zero, it can effectively choose one feature over the other highly correlated features.

8. **Choosing Optimal Regularization Parameter**:
   - The optimal value of the regularization parameter in Lasso Regression can be selected using techniques like cross-validation. By evaluating the model's performance (e.g., using mean squared error) across different values of \(\lambda\), the value that minimizes the error on unseen data can be chosen.
