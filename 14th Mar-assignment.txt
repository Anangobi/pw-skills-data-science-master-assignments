Q1. Write a Python function that takes in two arrays of data and calculates the F-value for a variance ratio
test. The function should return the F-value and the corresponding p-value for the test.

from scipy.stats import f

def calculate_F_value(data1, data2):
    F_value = np.var(data1) / np.var(data2)
    df1 = len(data1) - 1
    df2 = len(data2) - 1
    p_value = f.cdf(F_value, df1, df2)
    return F_value, p_value



Q2. Given a significance level of 0.05 and the degrees of freedom for the numerator and denominator of an
F-distribution, write a Python function that returns the critical F-value for a two-tailed test.

def critical_F_value(alpha, dfn, dfd):
    return f.ppf(1 - alpha / 2, dfn, dfd)


Q3. Write a Python program that generates random samples from two normal distributions with known

variances and uses an F-test to determine if the variances are equal. The program should output the F-
value, degrees of freedom, and p-value for the test.

def f_test_equal_variances(data1, data2):
    F_value, p_value = calculate_F_value(data1, data2)
    dfn = len(data1) - 1
    dfd = len(data2) - 1
    return F_value, dfn, dfd, p_value


Q4.The variances of two populations are known to be 10 and 15. A sample of 12 observations is taken from
each population. Conduct an F-test at the 5% significance level to determine if the variances are
significantly different.

# Example usage for Q4
data1 = np.random.normal(0, np.sqrt(10), 12)
data2 = np.random.normal(0, np.sqrt(15), 12)
F_value, p_value = calculate_F_value(data1, data2)
alpha = 0.05
if p_value < alpha:
    print("Reject null hypothesis: Variances are significantly different.")
else:
    print("Fail to reject null hypothesis: Variances are not significantly different.")


Q5. A manufacturer claims that the variance of the diameter of a certain product is 0.005. A sample of 25
products is taken, and the sample variance is found to be 0.006. Conduct an F-test at the 1% significance
level to determine if the claim is justified.

# Example usage for Q4
data1 = np.random.normal(0, np.sqrt(10), 12)
data2 = np.random.normal(0, np.sqrt(15), 12)
F_value, p_value = calculate_F_value(data1, data2)
alpha = 0.05
if p_value < alpha:
    print("Reject null hypothesis: Variances are significantly different.")
else:
    print("Fail to reject null hypothesis: Variances are not significantly different.")


Q6. Write a Python function that takes in the degrees of freedom for the numerator and denominator of an
F-distribution and calculates the mean and variance of the distribution. The function should return the
mean and variance as a tuple.

def f_distribution_mean_variance(dfn, dfd):
    mean = dfd / (dfd - 2)
    variance = (2 * (dfd ** 2) * (dfn + dfd - 2)) / (dfn * (dfd - 2) ** 2 * (dfd - 4))
    return mean, variance


Q7. A random sample of 10 measurements is taken from a normal population with unknown variance. The
sample variance is found to be 25. Another random sample of 15 measurements is taken from another
normal population with unknown variance, and the sample variance is found to be 20. Conduct an F-test
at the 10% significance level to determine if the variances are significantly different.


# Example usage for Q4
data1 = np.random.normal(0, np.sqrt(10), 12)
data2 = np.random.normal(0, np.sqrt(15), 12)
F_value, p_value = calculate_F_value(data1, data2)
alpha = 0.05
if p_value < alpha:
    print("Reject null hypothesis: Variances are significantly different.")
else:
    print("Fail to reject null hypothesis: Variances are not significantly different.")


Q8. The following data represent the waiting times in minutes at two different restaurants on a Saturday
night: Restaurant A: 24, 25, 28, 23, 22, 20, 27; Restaurant B: 31, 33, 35, 30, 32, 36. Conduct an F-test at the 5%
significance level to determine if the variances are significantly different.

# Example usage for Q4
data1 = np.random.normal(0, np.sqrt(10), 12)
data2 = np.random.normal(0, np.sqrt(15), 12)
F_value, p_value = calculate_F_value(data1, data2)
alpha = 0.05
if p_value < alpha:
    print("Reject null hypothesis: Variances are significantly different.")
else:
    print("Fail to reject null hypothesis: Variances are not significantly different.")



Q9. The following data represent the test scores of two groups of students: Group A: 80, 85, 90, 92, 87, 83;
Group B: 75, 78, 82, 79, 81, 84. Conduct an F-test at the 1% significance level to determine if the variances
are significantly different.

# Example usage for Q4
data1 = np.random.normal(0, np.sqrt(10), 12)
data2 = np.random.normal(0, np.sqrt(15), 12)
F_value, p_value = calculate_F_value(data1, data2)
alpha = 0.05
if p_value < alpha:
    print("Reject null hypothesis: Variances are significantly different.")
else:
    print("Fail to reject null hypothesis: Variances are not significantly different.")
