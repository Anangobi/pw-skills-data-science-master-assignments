### Q1: Ridge Regression vs. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression
- **Ridge Regression**: A regularization technique that adds a penalty term (L2 norm) to the OLS cost function, aiming to shrink coefficients and prevent overfitting.
- **Difference**: OLS minimizes the sum of squared residuals, while Ridge adds a penalty term to control the magnitude of coefficients.

### Q2: Assumptions of Ridge Regression
- Similar to OLS assumptions: linearity, independence, homoscedasticity. 
- However, Ridge Regression is less sensitive to multicollinearity, relaxing the multicollinearity assumption to some extent.

### Q3: Selecting Tuning Parameter (Lambda) in Ridge Regression
- Cross-validation or grid search techniques are commonly used to find the optimal lambda value.
- Choose lambda that minimizes the prediction error on a validation dataset.

### Q4: Ridge Regression for Feature Selection
- Ridge Regression does not perform explicit feature selection by reducing coefficients to zero, unlike Lasso.
- It shrinks coefficients towards zero but retains all features, which may help mitigate the impact of multicollinearity rather than select features.

### Q5: Ridge Regression and Multicollinearity
- Ridge Regression is effective in handling multicollinearity by reducing the impact of highly correlated predictors.
- It stabilizes the coefficients by shrinking them towards zero, making them less sensitive to changes caused by multicollinearity.

### Q6: Handling Categorical and Continuous Variables in Ridge Regression
- Ridge Regression can handle both categorical and continuous variables without any special preprocessing.
- However, categorical variables might need encoding (e.g., one-hot encoding) to represent them numerically.

### Q7: Interpretation of Coefficients in Ridge Regression
- Similar to OLS, coefficients represent the change in the dependent variable for a unit change in the respective predictor, considering other predictors constant.
- But in Ridge, coefficients are penalized and tend to be smaller compared to OLS.

### Q8: Use of Ridge Regression in Time Series Data
- Ridge Regression can be adapted for time-series analysis, especially in cases where multicollinearity or overfitting is a concern.
- It helps in stabilizing coefficients and preventing overfitting due to correlated predictors in time-series datasets.

Ridge Regression offers a way to mitigate multicollinearity and overfitting, making it beneficial in scenarios where these issues affect the performance of traditional regression models.
