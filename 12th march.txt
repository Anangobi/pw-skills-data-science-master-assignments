Q8. A researcher hypothesizes that a coin is biased towards tails. They flip the coin 100 times and observe
45 tails. Conduct a chi-square goodness of fit test to determine if the observed frequencies match the
expected frequencies of a fair coin. Use a significance level of 0.05.


To conduct a chi-square goodness of fit test, we need to calculate the expected frequencies under the assumption of a fair coin, and then compare them to the observed frequencies using the chi-square statistic.

In this case, the expected frequencies for a fair coin would be 50 tails and 50 heads out of 100 flips. We can calculate the expected frequency for tails as:
expected_tails = 0.5 * 100 = 50
The expected frequency for heads is also 50.

Now, we can set up the null and alternative hypotheses for the chi-square test:

Null hypothesis (H0): The observed frequencies do not differ significantly from the expected frequencies.
Alternative hypothesis (Ha): The observed frequencies differ significantly from the expected frequencies.
We can use a significance level of 0.05, which means that we will reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is less than 0.05.

Next, we need to calculate the chi-square statistic and the corresponding p-value. The chi-square statistic is calculated as:
chi2 = sum((observed - expected)**2 / expected)
observed = [45, 55]
expected = [50, 50]
chi2 = sum((observed - expected)**2 / expected) = (5**2/50) + (5**2/50) = 1
from scipy.stats import chi2

p_value = 1 - chi2.cdf(1, 1)

print("The p-value is {:.4f}".format(p_value))


Q9.A study was conducted to determine if there is an association between smoking status (smoker or
non-smoker) and lung cancer diagnosis (yes or no). The results are shown in the contingency table below.
Conduct a chi-square test for independence to determine if there is a significant association between
smoking status and lung cancer diagnosis.
Lung Cancer:            Yes        No

Smoker                      60       140
Non-smoker              30       170
Use a significance level of 0.05.

To conduct a chi-square test for independence, we first need to set up the null and alternative hypotheses:

Null hypothesis (H0): There is no association between smoking status and lung cancer diagnosis.
Alternative hypothesis (Ha): There is a significant association between smoking status and lung cancer diagnosis.
We can use a significance level of 0.05, which means that we will reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is less than 0.05.

Next, we need to calculate the chi-square statistic and the corresponding p-value. We can do this using the chi2_contingency function from the scipy.stats module in Python:

from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

observed = [[60, 140], [30, 170]]
chi2, p, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(observed)

print("The chi-square statistic is {:.2f}.".format(chi2))
print("The p-value is {:.4f}.".format(p))


Q10. A study was conducted to determine if the proportion of people who prefer milk chocolate, dark
chocolate, or white chocolate is different in the U.S. versus the U.K. A random sample of 500 people from
the U.S. and a random sample of 500 people from the U.K. were surveyed. The results are shown in the
contingency table below. Conduct a chi-square test for independence to determine if there is a significant
association between chocolate preference and country of origin.
                     Milk Chocolate       Dark chocolate     white chocolate

U.S. (n=500)            200                        150                          150
U.K. (n=500)            225                        175                          100

To conduct a chi-square test for independence, we first need to set up the null and alternative hypotheses:

Null hypothesis (H0): There is no association between chocolate preference and country of origin.
Alternative hypothesis (Ha): There is a significant association between chocolate preference and country of origin.
We can use a significance level of 0.05, which means that we will reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is less than 0.05.

Next, we need to calculate the chi-square statistic and the corresponding p-value. We can do this using the chi2_contingency function from the scipy.stats module in Python:

from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

observed = [[200, 150, 150], [225, 175, 100]]
chi2, p, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(observed)

print("The chi-square statistic is {:.2f}.".format(chi2))
print("The p-value is {:.4f}.".format(p))



Q11. A random sample of 30 people was selected from a population with an unknown mean and standard
deviation. The sample mean was found to be 72 and the sample standard deviation was found to be 10.
Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the population mean is significantly different from 70. Use a
significance level of 0.05.

We are given:

Sample size (n) = 30
Sample mean (x̄) = 72
Sample standard deviation (s) = 10
Null hypothesis (H0): population mean (μ) = 70
Alternative hypothesis (Ha): population mean (μ) ≠ 70
Significance level (α) = 0.05
Since the sample size is less than 30, we can use the t-test instead of the z-test.

We need to calculate the t-statistic and the corresponding p-value to determine if we reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.

The t-statistic can be calculated as follows:

t = (x̄ - μ) / (s / sqrt(n))
t = (72 - 70) / (10 / sqrt(30))
t = 1.095

Using a t-distribution table with degrees of freedom (df) = n - 1 = 29 and a two-tailed test with a significance level of 0.05, we find that the critical t-value is ±2.045.

The p-value is the probability of observing a sample mean as extreme or more extreme than the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. We can calculate it using a t-distribution table or a t-distribution calculator.

Using a t-distribution calculator with 29 degrees of freedom and a two-tailed test, we find that the p-value is 0.284.

Since the p-value (0.284) is greater than the significance level (0.05), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. We do not have sufficient evidence to conclude that the population mean is significantly different from 70 at a 5% level of significance.

Therefore, we can conclude that there is not enough evidence to suggest that the population mean is different from 70.
