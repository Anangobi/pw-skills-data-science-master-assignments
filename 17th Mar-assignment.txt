Q1: Missing Values
Definition: Missing values refer to the absence of data in specific fields within a dataset.
Importance of Handling: They can adversely affect model performance by introducing bias or reducing the effectiveness of algorithms.
Algorithms Not Affected: Tree-based algorithms like Random Forests or Decision Trees are less affected by missing values.

Q2: Techniques for Handling Missing Data

Imputation: Filling missing values with statistical measures.

# Example: Imputation with mean
df['column'].fillna(df['column'].mean(), inplace=True)

Deletion: Removing rows or columns with missing values.

# Example: Dropping rows with missing values
df.dropna(axis=0, inplace=True)


Q3: Imbalanced Data
Imbalanced Data: It refers to datasets where one class dominates the other(s) in terms of occurrences.
Consequences: Models might have bias toward the majority class, affecting their ability to predict the minority class.

Q4: Up-sampling and Down-sampling
Up-sampling: Increasing the number of instances in the minority class.
Down-sampling: Decreasing the number of instances in the majority class.
Requirement Example: Up-sampling for rare event prediction; Down-sampling to balance classes.


Q5: Data Augmentation and SMOTE
Data Augmentation: Technique to artificially increase the size of a dataset by creating modified versions of existing data points.
SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique): It generates synthetic samples for the minority class to balance the dataset.


Q6: Outliers
Outliers: Data points significantly different from other observations in a dataset.
Importance: Outliers can skew statistical analyses and affect model accuracy, hence essential to handle.

Q7: Techniques to Handle Missing Data in Analysis
Imputation: Fill missing values with mean, median, mode, or use advanced imputation techniques.
Deletion: Remove rows/columns with missing data if they don't significantly impact the analysis.
Predictive Techniques: Use models to predict missing values based on available data.


Q8: Strategies to Determine Pattern in Missing Data
Visualization: Plot missing values to identify patterns.
Statistical Tests: Check correlations between missing values in different columns.
Machine Learning Models: Use models to predict missing values based on other features.


Q9: Evaluating Performance on Imbalanced Dataset
Use Evaluation Metrics: Employ metrics like precision, recall, F1-score instead of accuracy.
Sampling Techniques: Implement up-sampling, down-sampling, or use techniques like SMOTE.

Q10: Balancing an Unbalanced Dataset with Majority Class
Down-sampling: Reduce the number of instances in the majority class.
Synthetic Data Generation: Use techniques like SMOTE to balance the dataset.


Q11: Balancing an Unbalanced Dataset with Minority Class
Up-sampling: Increase the number of instances in the minority class using duplication or synthetic data generation.
