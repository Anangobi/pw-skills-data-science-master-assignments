There are primarily three types:

Supervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning
Semi-Supervised Learning



Q2- What is supKrvisKd lKarnin*? List somK K=amplKs of supKrvisKd lKarnin*.

Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the input and the desired output are provided.
Examples:

Classification: Predicting whether an email is spam or not.
Regression: Predicting house prices based on features like area, location, etc.

Q3- GWhat is unsupKrvisKd lKarnin*? List somK K=amplKs of unsupKrvisKd lKarnin*.

Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data, aiming to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures within it.
Examples:

Clustering: Grouping similar customers based on purchasing behavior.
Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of variables while retaining meaningful information.

Q4- What is thK diffKrKncK bKtwKKn AI, ML, DL, and DS?

AI (Artificial Intelligence): The broader concept of creating machines that can simulate human intelligence.
ML (Machine Learning): A subset of AI where algorithms learn patterns from data and make predictions.
DL (Deep Learning): A subset of ML using neural networks with many layers to learn representations of data.
DS (Data Science): The field that deals with extracting insights and knowledge from data using various techniques, including ML.

Q5- What arK thK main diffKrKncKs bKtwKKn supKrvisKd, unsupKrvisKd, and sKmi-supKrvisKd lKarnin*?

Supervised Learning: Requires labeled data for training.
Unsupervised Learning: Uses unlabeled data to find hidden patterns.
Semi-Supervised Learning: Combination of both; uses labeled and unlabeled data during training.

Q6- What is train, tKst and validation split? E=plain thK importancK of Kach tKrm.

Train: Data used to train the model.
Test: Data used to evaluate the model's performance.
Validation: Subset of the training data used to tune hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.

Q7- How can unsupKrvisKd lKarnin* bK usKd in anomaly dKtKction?

Unsupervised learning can detect anomalies by identifying patterns that deviate significantly from the norm within the data.


Q8- List down somK commonly usKd supKrvisKd lKarnin* al*orithms and unsupKrvisKd lKarnin*
al*orithms.
